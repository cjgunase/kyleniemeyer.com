Teaching Statement
==================

As both a senior undergraduate and graduate student I served as a teaching assistant a total of five times, primarily for courses on advanced engineering mathematics and aero/gas dynamics. In this position, I not only assisted with creating homework assignments and exams, and the grading rubrics for each, but also led class review sessions and occasionally served as a guest lecturer. In addition, I interacted with students one-on-one both during and beyond formal office hours, frequently responding to late-night email questions. As a full instructor, I would strive to offer the same level of responsiveness and availability to my students.

These interactions, in addition to my own experiences as a student, contributed to my teaching philosophy, which consists of three primary, interconnected tenets:

 * Applying fundamental theory and numerical methods to real-world, interesting problems, emphasizing programming skills
 * Developing students' critical engineering thinking and problem-solving skills
 * Using a science communication methodology to teach complex engineering concepts

In my experience both as a student and teaching assistant, a common issue with engineering and applied mathematics courses---particularly introductory and fundamental courses---is a lack of examples and problems with real-world, interesting applications. Not only are these more useful to engineering students as they learn how to apply their theoretical skills, but also more interesting and therefore help students learn and retain the underlying concepts. For example, as the instructor of an engineering mathematics course I would supplement teaching partial differential equations with an assignment to calculate the amount of time needed to cool a can of beer in the fridge, using the cylindrical, time-dependent heat equation. In a numerical methods course, on the other hand, I would finish up the semester with a project applying one of the methods learned to an applied problem where analytical solutions don't exist or aren't practical. For example, finding the frequencies of a vibrating drum, which requires numerically calculating roots of the Bessel functions, or using the Gauss--Seidel method to solve the Laplace equation for heat conduction in a plate or even the above heat equation. Of course, we must also teach the students how to approach such real-world problems.

In order for students to apply their skills, I believe we must also focus on teaching the engineering-thinking and problem-solving skills that are crucial for both industrial careers and graduate research. This means going beyond rote book problems to more applied, in-depth applications they might experience on the job; problems where the solution procedure isn't entirely clear and that require approximations, assumptions, and additional research. For example, the instructor of the engineering mathematics course I assisted multiple times assigned a problem asking students to approximate the amount of time a car engine had been cooling based on later temperature measurements, in order to verify a suspected criminal's alibi. This required applying Newton's law of cooling and making assumptions for the original temperature and material properties. Assigning such problems throughout a course would allow me to gauge how well students are learning these thinking skills and adjust my teaching accordingly.

Related to these principles is my belief that courses must emphasize programming skills through application of the above types of problems. In the real world, both industry and academia, most problems don't have neat analytical solutions, requiring numerical algorithms. Modern engineering relies heavily on simulation and computational modeling, so building strong programming skills---and the understanding of how to apply them---at the undergraduate level is a necessity.

Finally, I also believe in the importance of communicating complex science and engineering ideas to students by reducing the use of jargon and breaking concepts down into more easily understood pieces. As a teaching assistant working one-on-one with students, I tried to develop these skills. In addition, I occasionally write science/engineering articles for the website [Ars Technica](http://www.arstechnica.com), where I summarize and explain published research papers to a technically but not scientifically literate audience. Not only has this helped improve my writing and communication skills, but through a robust commenting system and typically enthusiastic reader participation in discussions it also gave me feedback about my ability to explain complex subjects.
