Research <br/> Interests
==================

My research interests generally include developing tools and strategies to integrate accurate physical models into practical engineering simulations; my current work involves developing chemical mechanism reduction methods and algorithms to use graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable the use of detailed, predictive chemical models in combustion and reactive-flow simulations. More generally, I am also interested in developing strategies to accelerate science and engineering computations with GPUs.

Experience
==========

**Oregon State University**, Corvallis, OR  
*Assistant Professor (Senior Research)* 2014--
Efforts include performing research, teaching mechanical engineering courses, pursuing externally funded research programs, and advising students. Research interests focus on computational modeling for multi-physics fluid flows relevant to applications in aerospace, transportation, and
energy systems.

**Oregon State University**, Corvallis, OR  
*Postdoctoral Researcher*, 2013--2014
Performed research in various areas and taught a mechanical engineering course. Lead researcher on industrially supported project investigating the performance of various fuels in advanced combustion engines, responsible for monthly progress reports and ensuring progress under overall guidance of PI. In addition, performed research into chemical reaction mechanism reduction

**Case Western Reserve University**, Cleveland, Ohio  
*Graduate Research Assistant*, 2008--2013  
Pursued research on methods to reduce the cost of detailed chemistry in 
combustion modeling, including mechanism reduction approaches and GPU computing.  Helped advise a junior graduate student. Lead writer for multiple grant proposals, including NSF and DOE.

**United Technologies Research Center**, East Hartford, Connecticut  
*Summer Research Intern*, Summer 2011  
Developed new method to accelerate reactive flow simulations for hypersonics
using graphics processing units (GPUs). Presented results and future work, 
as well as deliverables, to upper-level management. Worked with Drs. Jeremiah 
C. Lee and Catalin G. Fotache in the Combustion Group. This work led to a [conference paper](/files/pubs/niemeyer_etal_essci2011.pdf).

**[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/)**  
*Associate Science Writer*, June 2011--  
Reported on scientific articles covering a range of topics (e.g., energy, 
climate, technology) to a technically but not necessarily scientifically 
literate audience, with audiences of in the tens of thousands each month. 
Articles took complex ideas from scholarly papers and broke the concepts 
down to be easily understandable. Readers participated in discussions and 
provided feedback through comments on articles.

**Case Western Reserve University**, Cleveland, Ohio  
*Teaching Assistant*, 2007--2010  
Assisted instructors with homework and exam grading, class instruction, 
and review sessions, and held regular office hours.
