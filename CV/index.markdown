Research Interests
==================

My research interests generally include developing tools and strategies to integrate accurate physical models into practical engineering simulations; my current work involves developing chemical mechanism reduction methods and algorithms to use graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable the use of detailed, predictive chemical models in combustion and reactive-flow simulations. More generally, I am also interested in developing strategies to accelerate science and engineering computations with GPUs.

Experience
==========

**United Technologies Research Center**, East Hartford, Connecticut  
Summer Research Intern, Summer 2011  
Developed new method to accelerate reactive flow simulations for hypersonics
using graphics processing units (GPUs). Presented results and future work, 
as well as deliverables, to upper-level management. Worked with Drs. Jeremiah 
C. Lee and Catalin G. Fotache in the Combustion Group. This work led to a [conference paper](/files/pubs/niemeyer_etal_essci2011.pdf).

**[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/)**  
Associate Science Writer, June 2011--  
Reported on scientific articles covering a range of topics (e.g., energy, 
climate, technology) to a technically but not necessarily scientifically 
literate audience, with audiences of in the tens of thousands each month. 
Articles took complex ideas from scholarly papers and broke the concepts 
down to be easily understandable. Readers participated in discussions and 
provided feedback through comments on articles.

**Case Western Reserve University**, Cleveland, Ohio  
Graduate Research Assistant, August 2008--  
Includes current Ph.D. research, graduate level coursework, and research 
projects. Lead writer for multiple grant proposals, including NSF and DOE. 
Advised and managed one master's student.

Teaching Assistant, 2007--2010  
Assisted instructors with homework and exam grading, class instruction, 
and review sessions, and held regular office hours.

**NASA Glenn Research Center**, Cleveland, Ohio  
Summer Intern, Combustion Branch, May--August 2008  
Assessed computational fluid dynamics software for Cryogenic Fluid 
Management project development and validation under Dr. Jeffrey P. Moder. 
Presented results of work to researchers in combustion group as well as
peers.

**Case Western Reserve University**, Cleveland, Ohio  
Undergraduate Research Assistant, January--December 2007  
Worked under [Prof. Christopher Hernandez](http://www.mae.cornell.edu/people/profile.cfm?netid=cjh275) 
with a team of undergraduate and graduate students to develop automated 
algorithms to process and analyze high-resolution image samples. Also 
performed individual research studying size effects in cellular solids 
such as metal foams and trabecular bone.
