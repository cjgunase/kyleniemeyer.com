Research
========
I'm an Assistant Professor, Senior Research, of mechanical engineering in the [School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering][mime] 
at [Oregon State University][osu] in Corvallis, Oregon.  

I received my PhD in mechanical engineering at [Case Western Reserve University][case] in August 2013. My advisor was [Professor Jackie Sung][sung] of the [Combustion Diagnostics Laboratory][cdl] at the University of Connecticut.

_20--22 April 2015:_ Attending and presenting talk on using GPUs for chemical kinetics in combustion simulations at the [15th International Conference on Numerical Combustion](http://www.nc15.ecp.fr/) in Avignon, France.

_11 April 2015:_ My [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2015.04.010) on a new fuel performance index for low-temperature combustion with Shane Daly, William Cannella, and [Christopher Hagen](http://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/hagen) has been accepted for publication in [*Fuel*](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00162361).

_24--26 March 2015:_ Attended High Pressure High Reynolds Number Combustion workshop at KAUST in Saudi Arabia.

_(apologies for the lack of updates... plenty happened in this time!)_

_27 August 2013:_ An article written by my PhD advisor, [Chih-Jen Sung][sung], and myself about our work in GPU computing for combustion modeling made the front pages of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC) [newsletter](http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/Newsletters/CEFRCnewsVol4Issue1.pdf).
