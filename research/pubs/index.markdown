### Abstract ###
Critical to the development of predictive combustion models is a robust understanding of the coupled effects of chemical kinetics and convective–diffusive transport at both atmospheric and elevated pressures. The present study describes a new variable-pressure non-premixed counterflow ignition experiment designed to address the need for well-characterized reference data to validate such models under conditions sensitive to both chemical and transport processes. A comprehensive characterization of system behavior is provided to demonstrate boundary condition and ignition quality as well as adherence to the assumption of quasi-one-dimensionality, and suggest limitations and best practices for counterflow ignition experiments. This effort reveals that the counterflow ignition experiment requires special attention to ignition location in order to ensure that the assumption of quasi-one-dimensionality is valid, particularly at elevated pressures. This experimental tool is then applied to the investigation of *n*-butanol for pressures of 1–4 atm, pressure-weighted strain rates of 200–400 s<sup>−1</sup>, and fuel mole fractions of 0.05–0.25. Results are simulated using two *n*-butanol models available in the literature and used to validate and assess model performance. Comparison of experimental and numerical ignition results for *n*-butanol demonstrates that while existing models largely capture the trends observed with varying pressure, strain rate, and fuel loading, the models universally over-predict experimental ignition temperatures. While several transport coefficients are found to exhibit order-of-magnitude or greater sensitivities relative to reaction rates, variation of transport parameters is not able to account for the large deviations observed between experimental and numerical results. Further comparison of ignition kernel structure and fuel breakdown pathways between two literature models suggests that an under-prediction in the radical pool growth with respect to temperature variation may be responsible for both the deviation from the experimental results and the discrepancy in ignition temperature results observed between models.

### Abstract ###
In this paper, the methodology of the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA), proposed by Niemeyer et al. \[Combustion and Flame 155 (2010) 1760--1770\], and its differences to the original directed relation graph method are described. Using DRGEPSA, the detailed mechanism of ethylene containing 71 species and 395 reaction steps is reduced to several skeletal mechanisms with different error thresholds. The 25 species and 131 steps mechanism and the 24 species and 115 steps mechanism are found to be accurate for the predictions of ignition delay time and laminar flame speed. Although further reduction leads to a smaller skeletal mechanism with 19 species and 68 steps, it is no longer able to represent the correct reaction processes. With the DRGEPSA method, a detailed mechanism for n-dodecane considering low-temperature chemistry and containing 2115 species and 8157 steps is reduced to a much smaller mechanism with 249 species and 910 steps while retaining good accuracy. If considering only high-temperature (higher than 1000 K) applications, the detailed mechanism can be simplified to even smaller mechanisms with 65 species and 340 steps or 48 species and 220 steps. Furthermore, a detailed mechanism for a kerosene surrogate having 207 species and 1592 steps is reduced with various error thresholds and the results show that the 72 species and 429 steps mechanism and the 66 species and 392 steps mechanism are capable of predicting correct combustion properties compared to those of the detailed mechanism. It is well recognized that kinetic mechanisms can be effectively used in computations only after they are reduced to an acceptable size level for computation capacity and at the same time retaining accuracy. Thus, the skeletal mechanisms generated from the present work are expected to be useful for the application of kinetic mechanisms of hydrocarbons to numerical simulations of turbulent or supersonic combustion.

### Abstract ###
A new metric for ranking the suitability of fuels in LTC engines was recently introduced, based on the fraction of potential fuel savings achieved in the FTP-75 light-duty vehicle driving cycle. In the current study, this LTC fuel performance index was calculated and analyzed for a number of fuel blends comprised of n-heptane, isooctane, toluene, and ethanol in various combinations and ratios corresponding to octane numbers from 0 to 100. In order to calculate the LTC index for each fuel, driving cycle simulations were first performed using a typical light-duty passenger vehicle, providing pairs of engine speed and load points. Separately, for each fuel blend considered, single-zone naturally aspirated HCCI engine simulations with a compression ratio of 9.5 were performed in order to determine the operating envelopes. These results were combined to determine the varying improvement in fuel economy offered by fuels, forming the basis for the LTC fuel index. The resulting fuel performance indices ranged from 36.4 for neat n-heptane (PRF0) to 9.20 for a three-component blend of *n*-heptane, isooctane, and ethanol (ERF1). For the chosen engine and chosen conditions, in general lower-octane fuels performed better, resulting in higher LTC fuel index values; however, the fuel performance index correlated poorly with octane rating for less-reactive, higher-octane fuels.

### Abstract ###
Low-temperature combustion (LTC) engine concepts such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) offer the potential of improved efficiency and reduced emissions of NOx and particulates. However, engines can only successfully operate in HCCI mode for limited operating ranges that vary depending on the fuel composition. Unfortunately, traditional ratings such as octane number poorly predict the autoignition behavior of fuels in such engine modes, and metrics recently proposed for HCCI engines have areas of improvement when wide ranges of fuels are considered. In this study, a new index for ranking fuel suitability for LTC engines was defined, based on the fraction of potential fuel savings achieved in the FTP-75 light-duty vehicle driving cycle. Driving cycle simulations were performed using a typical light-duty passenger vehicle, providing pairs of engine speed and load points. Separately, single-zone naturally aspirated HCCI engine simulations were performed for a variety of fuels in order to determine the operating envelopes for each. These results were combined to determine the varying improvement in fuel economy offered by fuels, forming the basis for a fuel performance index. Results showed that, in general, lower octane fuels performed better, resulting in higher LTC fuel index values; however, octane number alone did not predict fuel performance.

“Reduced chemistry for a gasoline surrogate valid at engine-relevant conditions.”

### Abstract ###
A detailed mechanism for the four-component RD387 gasoline surrogate developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has shown good agreement with experiments in engine-relevant conditions. However, with 1388 species and 5933 reversible reactions, this detailed mechanism is far too large to use in practical engine simulations. Therefore, reduction of the detailed mechanism was performed using a multi-stage approach consisting of the DRGEPSA method, unimportant reaction elimination, isomer lumping, and analytic QSS reduction based on CSP analysis. A new greedy sensitivity analysis algorithm was developed and demonstrated to be capable of removing more species for the same error limit compared to the conventional sensitivity analysis used in DRG-based skeletal reduction methods. Using this new greedy algorithm, several skeletal and reduced mechanisms were developed at varying levels of complexity and for different target condition ranges. The final skeletal and reduced mechanisms consisted of 213 and 148 species, respectively, for a lean-to-stoichiometric, low-temperature HCCI-like range of conditions. For a lean-to-rich, high-temperature, SI/CI-like range of conditions, skeletal and reduced mechanisms were developed with 97 and 79 species, respectively. The skeletal and reduced mechanisms in this study were produced using an error limit of 10% and validated using homogeneous autoignition simulations over engine-relevant conditions—all showed good agreement in predicting ignition delay. Furthermore, extended validation was performed, including comparison of autoignition temperature profiles, PSR temperature response curves and extinction turning points, and laminar flame speed calculations. All the extended validation showed results within the 10% error limit, demonstrating the adequacy of the resulting reduced chemistry.

### Abstract ###
The relative importance index (RII) method for determining appropriate target species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is developed. The adequacy and effectiveness of this RII method is validated for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol, representatives of a ground transportation fuel component and bio-alcohol, respectively.

The conventional method of DRGEP target species selection involves picking an unchanging (static) set of target species based on the combustion processes of interest; however, these static target species may not remain important throughout the entire combustion simulation, adversely affecting the accuracy of the method. In particular, this behavior may significantly reduce the accuracy of the DRGEP-based DAC approach in complex multidimensional simulations where the encountered combustion conditions cannot be known a priori with high certainty. Moreover, testing multiple sets of static target species to ensure the accuracy of the method is generally computationally prohibitive. Instead, the RII method determines appropriate DRGEP target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets appropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration.

Constant volume autoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial conditions using detailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the RII method is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets. Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the RII method are compared to those of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under homogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more stringent DRGEP thresholds, the RII method performs similarly to that of the static target species sets. With a larger DRGEP threshold, the RII method is significantly more accurate than the static target species sets without imposing significant computational overhead.

Furthermore, the applicability of the RII method to a DRG-based DAC scheme is discussed.

### Abstract ###
Strategies and recommendations for performing skeletal reductions of multicomponent surrogate fuels are presented, through the generation and validation of skeletal mechanisms for a three-component toluene reference fuel. Using the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis method followed by a further unimportant reaction elimination stage, skeletal mechanisms valid over comprehensive and high-temperature ranges of conditions were developed at varying levels of detail. These skeletal mechanisms were generated based on autoignition simulations, and validation using ignition delay predictions showed good agreement with the detailed mechanism in the target range of conditions. When validated using phenomena other than autoignition, such as perfectly stirred reactor and laminar flame propagation, tight error control or more restrictions on the reduction during the sensitivity analysis stage were needed to ensure good agreement. In addition, tight error limits were needed for close prediction of ignition delay when varying the mixture composition away from that used for the reduction. In homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulations, the skeletal mechanisms closely matched the point of ignition and accurately predicted species profiles for lean to stoichiometric conditions. Furthermore, the efficacy of generating a multicomponent skeletal mechanism was compared to combining skeletal mechanisms produced separately for neat fuel components; using the same error limits, the latter resulted in a larger skeletal mechanism size that also lacked important cross reactions between fuel components. Based on the present results, general guidelines for reducing detailed mechanisms for multicomponent fuels are discussed.

### Abstract ###
The progress made in accelerating simulations of fluid flow using GPUs, and the challenges that remain, are surveyed. The review first provides an introduction to GPU computing and programming, and discusses various considerations for improved performance. Case studies comparing the performance of CPU- and GPU- based solvers for the Laplace and incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are performed in order to demonstrate the potential improvement even with simple codes. Recent efforts to accelerate CFD simulations using GPUs are reviewed for laminar, turbulent, and reactive flow solvers. Also, GPU implementations of the lattice Boltzmann method are reviewed. Finally, recommendations for implementing CFD codes on GPUs are given and remaining challenges are discussed, such as the need to develop new strategies and redesign algorithms to enable GPU acceleration.

### Abstract ###
The chemical kinetics ODEs arising from operator-split reactive-flow simulations were solved on GPUs using explicit integration algorithms. Nons- tiff chemical kinetics of a hydrogen oxidation mechanism (9 species and 38 irreversible reactions) were computed using the explicit fifth-order Runge--Kutta--Cash--Karp method, and the GPU-accelerated version performed faster than single- and six-core CPU versions by factors of 126 and 25, respectively, for 524,288 ODEs. Moderately stiff kinetics, represented with mechanisms for hydrogen/carbon-monoxide (13 species and 54 irreversible reactions) and methane (53 species and 634 irreversible reactions) oxidation, were computed using the stabilized explicit second-order Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev (RKC) algorithm. The GPU-based RKC implementation demonstrated an increase in performance of nearly 59 and 10 times, for problem sizes consisting of 262,144 ODEs and larger, than the single- and six-core CPU-based RKC algorithms using the hydrogen/carbon-monoxide mechanism. With the methane mechanism, RKC-GPU performed more than 65 and 11 times faster, for problem sizes consisting of 131,072 ODEs and larger, than the single- and six-core RKC-CPU versions, and up to 57 times faster than the six-core CPU-based implicit VODE algorithm on 65,536 ODEs. In the presence of more severe stiffness, such as ethylene oxidation (111 species and 1566 irreversible reactions), RKC-GPU performed more than 17 times faster than RKC-CPU on six cores for 32,768 ODEs and larger, and at best 4.5 times faster than VODE on six CPU cores for 65,536 ODEs. With a larger time step size, RKC-GPU performed at best 2.5 times slower than six-core VODE for 8192 ODEs and larger. Therefore, the need for developing new strategies for integrating stiff chemistry on GPUs was discussed.

### Abstract ###
The importance of graph search algorithm choice to the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is studied by comparing basic and modified depth-first search, basic and R-value-based breadth-first search (RBFS), and Dijkstra’s algorithm. By using each algorithm with DRGEP to produce skeletal mechanisms from a detailed mechanism for n-heptane with randomly-shuffled species order, it is demonstrated that only Dijkstra’s algorithm and RBFS produce results independent of species order. In addition, each algorithm is used with DRGEP to generate skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane covering a comprehensive range of autoignition conditions for pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio. Dijkstra’s algorithm combined with a coefficient scaling approach is demonstrated to produce the most compact skeletal mechanism with a similar performance compared to larger skeletal mechanisms resulting from the other algorithms. The computational efficiency of each algorithm is also compared by applying the DRGEP method with each search algorithm on the large detailed mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to n-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions. Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented with a binary heap priority queue is demonstrated as the most efficient method, with a CPU cost two orders of magnitude less than the other search algorithms.

### Abstract ###
A novel implementation for the skeletal reduction of large detailed reaction mechanisms using the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA) is developed and presented with examples for three hydrocarbon components, n-heptane, iso-octane, and n-decane, relevant to surrogate fuel development. DRGEPSA integrates two previously developed methods, directed relation graph-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) and directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP), by first applying DRGEP to efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to further remove unimportant species, producing an optimally small skeletal mechanism for a given error limit. It is illustrated that the combination of the DRGEP and DRGASA methods allows the DRGEPSA approach to overcome the weaknesses of each, specifically that DRGEP cannot identify all unimportant species and that DRGASA shields unimportant species from removal. Skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane and iso-octane generated using the DRGEP, DRGASA, and DRGEPSA methods are presented and compared to illustrate the improvement of DRGEPSA. From a detailed reaction mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to n-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions, two skeletal mechanisms for n-decane generated using DRGEPSA, one covering a comprehensive range of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio conditions for autoignition and the other limited to high temperatures, are presented and validated. The comprehensive skeletal mechanism consists of 202 species and 846 reactions and the high- temperature skeletal mechanism consists of 51 species and 256 reactions. Both mechanisms are further demonstrated to well reproduce the results of the detailed mechanism in perfectly-stirred reactor and laminar flame simulations over a wide range of conditions. The comprehensive and high-temperature n-decane skeletal mechanisms are included as supplementary material with this article.

For nonstiff systems, common explicit integration algorithms can be used on GPUs, where individual GPU threads concurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or parameters. One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge–Kutta–Cash–Karp (RKCK) algorithm. In the case of stiff ODEs, standard explicit algorithms require impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons, and implicit algorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and reduce the computational expense. However, typical high-order implicit algorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae (e.g., VODE, LSODE) involve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when implemented on GPUs, limiting the performance. Therefore, alternate algorithms are needed. A GPU-based Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev (RKC) algorithm can handle moderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an equivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm (VODE) based on results shown in the literature. In this chapter, we present the mathematical background, implementation details, and source code for the RKCK and RKC algorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on GPUs. In addition, brief performance comparisons are shown for each algorithm, demonstrating the potential benefit of moving to GPU-based ODE integrators.

### Abstract ###
Low-temperature combustion (LTC) engine concepts such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) offer the potential of improved efficiency and reduced emissions of NOx and particulates. However, engines can only successfully operate in HCCI mode for limited operating ranges that vary depending on the fuel composition. Unfortunately, traditional ratings such as octane number poorly predict the autoignition behavior of fuels in such engine modes, and metrics recently proposed for HCCI engines have areas of improvement when wide ranges of fuels are considered. In this study, a new index for ranking fuel suitability for LTC engines was defined, based on the fraction of potential fuel savings achieved in the FTP-75 light-duty vehicle driving cycle. Driving cycle simulations were performed using a typical light-duty passenger vehicle, providing pairs of engine speed and load points. Separately, single-zone naturally aspirated HCCI engine simulations were performed for a variety of fuels in order to determine the operating envelopes for each. These results were combined to determine the varying improvement in fuel economy offered by fuels, forming the basis for a fuel performance index. Results showed that, in general, lower octane fuels performed better, resulting in higher LTC fuel index values; however, octane number alone did not predict fuel performance.

### Abstract ###
Combustion simulations with detailed chemical kinetics require the integration of a large number of ordinary differential equation (ODEs), with at least one ODE system per spatial location solved every time step. This task is well-suited to the massively parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units (GPUs), where individual GPU threads concurrently integrate independent ODE systems for different spatial locations. However, the typical high-order implicit algorithms used in combustion modeling applications (e.g., VODE, LSODE) to handle stiffness involve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when implemented on GPUs, thus limiting performance. Alternate algorithms are therefore needed. This talk will discuss strategies and results using integration algorithms for nonstiff and stiff chemical kinetics on GPUs.

### Abstract ###
A detailed mechanism for four-component gasoline surrogates, developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), showed good agreement with experiments in engine-relevant conditions. However, with 1389 species and 5935 reversible reactions, the mechanism is far too large to use in practical engine simulations. Therefore, reduction of the mechanism was performed. First, the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA) method was used to generate skeletal mechanisms at varying levels of detail. This step produced significantly reduced skeletal mechanisms, but those with tight error limits were still too sizable for practical use. Therefore, a second reduction step was employed, using the quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation based on computational singular perturbation (CSP) analysis. The QSS species concentrations were solved analytically, rather than through an iterative solution approach. For error constraints of 10% and 30%, the final reduced mechanisms consist of 245 and 178 species, respectively. Both reduced mechanisms (and the corresponding skeletal mechanisms) were validated with homogeneous autoignition simulations over engine-relevant conditions, and both showed good agreement in predicting ignition delay.

### Abstract ###
The evaluation of finite-rate chemical kinetics occupies the majority of the processing time in combustion simulations, due to the stiffness of the governing rate equations. Graphics processing units (GPUs) offer the massive parallelism and processing power of a CPU cluster at a fraction of the cost and power consumption, in a single device. A novel stiff solver will be presented that accelerates the solution of chemical kinetics on GPUs.

The progress made in accelerating simulations of fluid flow using GPUs is surveyed. The review first provides an introduction to GPU computing and programming. A case study of simulating incompressible flow in a lid-driven cavity is performed, comparing the performance of CPU- and GPU-based solvers to demonstrate the potential improvement even with simple codes. Recent efforts to accelerate CFD simulations using GPUs are reviewed for reactive flow solvers. Finally, recommendations for implementing CFD codes on GPUs are given and remaining challenges are discussed, such as the need to develop new strategies and redesign algorithms to enable GPU acceleration.

### Abstract ###
Graphics processing units (GPUs) are attractive for high-performance computing due to their massively parallel architecture, modest power consumption, and relatively low cost. Recent attempts were made to speed up the chemical kinetics in reactive-flow simulations. However, these approaches did not realize the full potential of the GPU as inter-processor communication was intensive. In some popular high-fidelity closure models, there is a very large set (e.g. 10<sup>4</sup>--10<sup>6</sup>) of independent chemical kinetics integrations to perform. This leads to a new strategy of performing all the chemistry integrations on the GPU to minimize communication between the CPU and GPU and to maximize the computational load on the GPU. We demonstrated this technique with a detailed hydrogen kinetics system (9 species and 38 reactions) and observed a speed up factor of 70. Also, the computing time on the GPU is short enough that when the CPU is designed to handle the transport terms, the impact of chemistry on the overall computational "clock time" is minimal. Thus, for practical-scale LES simulations, the GPU allows the inclusion of detailed kinetics in closure models.

### Abstract ###
Skeletal mechanisms for TRF mixtures were generated using DRGEPSA followed by unimportant reaction elimination. A detailed mechanism with 1389 species and 5935 reactions was reduced to different levels of complexity ranging from 386 species and 1591 reactions (lowest error) to 173 species and 689 reactions (highest error). Validation was performed using ignition delay and laminar flame speed calculations, and good agreement with the detailed mechanism was found for the error limits considered. Representative HCCI simulations of normal and low-load operation were also performed using the skeletal mechanisms. All skeletal mechanisms predict ignition to within 4 CA degrees, but only the largest skeletal mechanism to within 1 CA degree. Fuel and CO mole fraction profiles were also compared with good agreement in general, but noticeable error in the exit CO mole fraction for the very lean low-load case.

### Abstract ###
Skeletal mechanism reduction based on the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) is explored with focus on the selection of graph search algorithm and application on primary reference fuels (PRF). It is demonstrated that R-value-based breadth-first search (BFS) and Dijkstra’s algorithm generate results independent of species order, while basic and modified depth-first search and basic BFS depend on the order of species in the reaction mechanism. Each of the search algorithms is also used with DRGEP to generate skeletal mechanisms for a detailed mechanism for n-heptane, consisting of 561 species and 2539 reactions, covering a comprehensive range of conditions for temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio. Dijkstra’s algorithm combined with a coefficient scaling approach generates the most compact skeletal mechanism compared to the other search algorithms for a 30% error limit, with 131 species and 651 reactions. A comprehensive reduction scheme including DRGEP with Dijkstra’s algorithm followed by sensitivity analysis and unimportant reaction elimination is then applied on a large binary (n-heptane and iso-octane) PRF mechanism, containing 1034 species and 4236 reactions, to generate skeletal mechanisms at varying levels of detail. The skeletal mechanisms with ∼100 species adequately predict the ignition delay and laminar flame speed calculations of the detailed mechanism.

A skeletal reduction of a detailed n-heptane mechanism was performed to illustrate the individual weaknesses of DRGEP and DRGASA and to show that DRGEPSA diminished these weaknesses. Furthermore, a comprehensive skeletal mechanism for n-decane was generated using DRGEPSA to demonstrate the applicability of the DRGEP method to the skeletal reduction of large surrogate fuel mechanisms. Specifically, the detailed mechanism of n-decane containing 940 species and 3887 reactions was reduced to a skeletal mechanism containing 211 species and 794 reactions, which exhibits good performance in predicting ignition delays over a wide range of equivalence ratios, temperatures, and pressures.

### Abstract ###
Two approaches for reducing the cost of detailed and accurate chemistry in reactive- flow simulations were studied and developed, specifically based on reaction mechanism reduction and GPU computing.  

The first part of this dissertation studied mechanism reduction methods. First, the reliability and efficacy of various graph search algorithms were compared for the DRGEP mechanism reduction method, and it was demonstrated that Dijkstra’s algorithm out-performed all others considered in terms of effectiveness and speed. Next, reduction strategies for multicomponent surrogate fuel mechanisms were demonstrated, based on the combination of DRGEPSA and unimportant reaction elimination using autoignition results, by generating skeletal mechanisms at varying levels of detail for TRFs (n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene). It was shown that significant reduction in mechanism size is possible, but care must be taken for wide-ranging accuracy, specifically for predicting phenomena outside autoignition, for accurate results across the mixture composition space, and to ensure close prediction of species profiles particularly for ultra-lean conditions. Finally, building on the previous results, a combined reduction strategy consisting of DRGEPSA, unimportant reaction elimination, isomer lumping, and CSP-based QSS reduction was used to generate skeletal and reduced mechanisms for a gasoline surrogate consisting of iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene, and 2-pentene. Different mechanisms were generated respectively targeted at lower-temperature HCCI-like and high-temperature SI/CI-engine conditions; validation was performed using autoignition, PSR, and laminar flame speed calculations.  

In the second part, the use of GPUs for accelerating reactive-flow simulation was studied. Strategies for optimizing CFD applications on GPUs were demonstrated using case studies solving the Laplace equation and flow in a lid-driven cavity. In addition, a comprehensive survey of efforts to date using GPUs to accelerate laminar, turbulent, and reactive flow solvers, including approaches based on the lattice Boltzmann method, was performed, and general findings and specific recommendations were made. Following this, a new strategy for integrating chemical kinetics with little-to-moderate stiffness on GPUs was presented. This approach used the Runge–Kutta–Cash–Karp algorithm to handle nonstiff hydrogen chemistry and the stabilized Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev algorithm to handle moderately stiff chemistry for hydrogen/carbon monoxide, methane, and ethylene kinetics. Speedup factors of between one and two orders of magnitude were shown compared to CPU-based integration algorithms. In the presence of more severe stiffness, the current algorithms were less effective, demonstrating the need for GPU-appropriate stiff method.

### Abstract ###
The Mechanism Automatic Reduction Software (MARS) implementation for chemical reaction mechanism reduction, with special emphasis on skeletal reduction using the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA), is developed and demonstrated with examples for three hydrocarbon components, n-heptane, iso-octane, and n-decane, relevant to surrogate fuel development. DRGEPSA integrates two previously developed methods, directed relation graph-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) and directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP), by first applying DRGEP to efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to further remove unimportant species, producing an optimally small skeletal mechanism for a given error limit. It is illustrated that the combination of the DRGEP and DRGASA methods allows the DRGEPSA approach to overcome the weaknesses of each, specifically that DRGEP cannot identify all unimportant species and that DRGASA shields unimportant species from removal. Skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane and iso-octane generated using the DRGEP, DRGASA, and DRGEPSA methods are presented and compared to illustrate the improvement of DRGEPSA. Two skeletal mechanisms for n-decane generated using DRGEPSA, one covering a comprehensive range of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio conditions for autoignition and the other limited to high temperatures, are presented and validated. Both mechanisms are further demonstrated to well reproduce the results of the detailed mechanism in perfectly-stirred reactor and laminar flame simulations over a wide range of conditions.
