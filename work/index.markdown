Research
========
I'm an Assistant Professor, Senior Research, of mechanical engineering in the [School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering][mime] 
at [Oregon State University][osu] in Corvallis, Oregon.  

I received my PhD in mechanical engineering at [Case Western Reserve University][case] in August 2013. My advisor was [Professor Jackie Sung][sung] of the [Combustion Diagnostics Laboratory][cdl] at the University of Connecticut.

News
====
_27 August 2013:_ An article written by my PhD advisor, [Professor Chih-Jen Sung][sung], and myself about our work in GPU computing for combustion modeling made the front pages of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC) [newsletter](http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/Newsletters/CEFRCnewsVol4Issue1.pdf).

_19 August 2013:_ Successfully defended my PhD dissertation, titled "Reducing the Cost of Chemistry in Reactive-Flow Simulations: Novel Mechanism Reduction Strategies and Acceleration via Graphics Processing Units."

_19--22 May 2013:_ Presented at the 10th US National Combustion Meeting in Park City, Utah. Here, I presented some new developments in our mechanism reduction algorithm as well as skeletal mechanisms for gasoline surrogates.

_8--10 April 2013:_ Presented at the SIAM 14th International Conference on Numerical Combustion in San Antonio, Texas. This talk presented some new results in addition to those I presented at the ASM in January. I was part of the minisymposium on GPU computing, which was recorded and will be available on the SIAM website [here](https://client.blueskybroadcast.com/SIAM13/NC/siam_nc13_MS8_2/).

_6--10 January 2013:_ Attended and presented at the 51st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting in Grapevine, Texas. My talk was on our efforts to accelerate reactive flow simulations using GPUs; check out my [paper](/files/pubs/Niemeyer-Sung-ASM_2013.pdf) for some background information and keep an eye out for an upcoming paper with the most recent results.

_16--17 October 2012:_ Attended [OpenACC GPU Programming Workshop](http://www.psc.edu/index.php/training/openacc-gpu-programming) at [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center](http://www.psc.edu)

_8 October 2012:_ Coauthored a feature article at [Ars Technica][ars] on future engine technology: ["The road ahead: How we'll get to 54.5 mpg by 2025"](http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/10/the-road-ahead-how-well-get-to-54-5-mpg-by-2025/)

_14 September 2012:_ Gave presentation at [Case Western Reserve][case] on how to apply and tips on getting the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship](http://ndseg.asee.org/); check out my [presentation](/files/KNiemeyer_NSF_GRFP_presentation.pdf).
