Origin
------

I switched to this site design after a couple years of using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), which was easy but not very powerful or clean looking. I could never find a theme that fit what I had in mind for the site, plus it was hacked at least once (although that may have been due at the server-level, WordPress certainly has vulnerabilities).

So, after seeing a bit about [Jekyll][] and realizing the benefits of a static site (speed, and no way to be hacked other than through the server), I decided to switch. I originally borrowed (and customized) [Mark Reid's site](http://mark.reid.name/), but more recently upgraded to using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS and a theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).
