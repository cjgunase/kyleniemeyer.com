## Abstract

Many engineering applications require fast, accurate solutions of fluid flow around freely moving bodies. The high performance and massive parallelism of GPUs offers a promising alternative to traditional solver acceleration via multicore CPUs. However, fully harnessing GPU parallelism requires specialized algorithms and computing strategies. This work modifies a direct-forcing IBM to model fluid-structure interaction and investigates its behavior on GPUs.
