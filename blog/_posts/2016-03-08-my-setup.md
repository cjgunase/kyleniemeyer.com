I love finding out what others use to get their work done, and [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/) is my favorite way to do that. In the hopes of getting listed there---and also to share what I use---here's my own personal interview.

## Kyle Niemeyer
Mechanical engineering professor (Oregon State University)

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Kyle Niemeyer](http://kyleniemeyer.com "Kyle's website") ([@kyle_niemeyer](http://twitter.com/kyle_niemeyer "Kyle on Twitter")), a professor in the [School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering](http://mime.oregonstate.edu "School where Kyle teaches") at [Oregon State University](http://oregonstate.edu "Kyle's university") in Corvallis, Oregon.
There, I do [research](http://kyleniemeyer.com/pubs/ "Research papers by Kyle") in combustion and fluid dynamics using computational modeling, and teach courses on numerical methods and fluid dynamics.

In my past life[^1], I also did some [science writing](http://arstechnica.com/author/kyle-niemeyer/ "Some articles written by Kyle.") for a little site called [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com "A technology news and information website.").
In addition to a good number of shorter stories, I also wrote some longer feature pieces on [future efficient engine technology](http://arstechnica.com/features/2012/10/the-road-ahead-how-well-get-to-54-5-mpg-by-2025/ "Article cowritten by Kyle on engine technology.") and [the revival of nuclear power in the United States](http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/03/chain-reaction-the-slow-revival-of-us-nuclear-power/ "Feature article by Kyle on nuclear power.").
I plan to do more writing like this, about my own work and that of others, once I figure out how to work that into my tenure-track faculty schedule.

[^1]: When I was a graduate student and had more "free" time.

## What hardware do you use?

I nearly live on a [13" MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ "A laptop."), whether I'm working from home in the evening, a coffeeshop on the weekend, an airport or plane, or (if possible) a beach.
This is my third Mac laptop; I purchased my first [MacBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook "A white polycarbonate-shelled laptop.") during the summer of 2006 between my first and second years of college[^2].
Compared to my previous MacBook Pro from 2010, my current laptop is quite a bit lighter, thinner, and more powerful, and is pretty much perfect.
The high-resolution Retina display is also pretty nice, especially in comparison to the older non-Retina display.

[^2]: I became so interested in Macs after getting my first that I worked as an [Apple Campus Rep](http://www.apple.com/education/campusreps/ "A job for college students to evangelize Apple products.") at [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu "University where Kyle went to school.") during college.

I carry an [iPhone 6S](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/ "A smartphone.") that travels with me everywhere, along with a [Baron Fig Confidant notebook](http://www.baronfig.com/pages/confidant "A general-purpose well-designed notebook.") and a [Timbuk2 Uptown Backpack](http://www.timbuk2.com/uptown-tsa-friendly-laptop-backpack/252-3-1022.html "A TSA-friendly laptop backpack.").
I'm also partial to [VELA A3 Advanced Computation Laboratory notebooks](http://www.amazon.com/VELA-Computation-Laboratory-Reinforced-Professional/dp/B00QAM7JGK/ "A softcover lay-flat lab notebook.").
Other than when I'm traveling, I pretty much always carry a pocketknife; although I tend to somewhat collect different models, my current carry is a [Deejo Juniper Wood 27G knife](http://collection.deejo.fr/deejo-wood-en-2/product-257.html "An ultra-light pocketknife").
Otherwise, the classic [Buck 55 folding knife](http://www.buckknives.com/product/the-55-knife/0055BRS-B/ "A classic folding knife.") is my long-term favorite.

I used to work off my laptop in my office, but I switched to a dedicated [27" Retina 5K iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/ "An all-in-one computer.") that I now use with a second [Dell P2715Q 4K 27" monitor](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2715Q-27-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00PC9HFO8?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAJM4NKIQGABP2PIRA&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&tag=thewire06-20&ascsubtag=WC14302 "A large high-resolution monitor"), as recommended by the [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-27-inch-monitor/ "Monitor recommendation by a tech research and review site.").
Both of these things sit on my [Ergo Depot Jarvis Bamboo](http://www.ergodepot.com/Jarvis_Desk_Bamboo_p/jrv-b.htm) standing desk, also recommended by [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/ "Standing desk recommendation by a tech research and review site.") (detecting a trend?); technically, the desk is adjustable for sitting and standing, but I've been working at a standing desk for about five years... so I stand 99% of the time.

I also recently acquired a [Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Scanner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ATZ9QMO&linkCode=as2&tag=gradescope-20&linkId=6BMEZSQRGENVZTNT "A scanner") for my office, in order to handle scanning large quantities of student quizzes and exams for grading via [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com/ "A web-based grading service.").

For research, when the iMac isn't sufficient, I have an [HP Z220 Workstation](http://www8.hp.com/ca/en/campaigns/workstations/z220.html "A moderate desktop workstation.") running [CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org "An open and free Linux distribution.") for running code (typically remotely).

## And what software?

Both of my computers run [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/ "An operating system for Mac hardware"), which has been my primary OS since my first Mac almost ten years ago. At this point, I dislike being forced to use Windows, and can't imagine switching back to lose, if nothing else, the Unix core.

Next to OS X and iOS, the single piece of software I use most frequently is my friend [Samuel Clay](http://www.samuelclay.com/)'s [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/ "A personal news reader."), between the website and [iOS app](https://www.newsblur.com/ios "RSS news reader iOS app.").

Following that, I constantly access [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kyle_niemeyer "Kyle on Twitter") using [Tweetbot for Mac](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/ "Twitter client for Mac.") and [Tweetbot for iOS](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/ "Twitter client for iOS."). I love the interface and syncing feature.

I rely on the standard Mac apps for my internet browsing, email, and calendar needs (Safari, Mail, and Calendar), mainly for the easy iCloud syncing between computers and my phone. I do tend to keep Chrome or Firefox running for "work" tabs (e.g., searches on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "Programming Q&A website."), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/ "An academic article search engine.")).

Beyond those apps, I use [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/ "A Mac task manager.") to keep track of my tasks across my computers and iPhone. [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com/mac/ "A bibliography management app.") maintains my library of (thousands of) academic papers. I've been a Papers customer for years now, and although their introduction of the latest major version was a bit rough, they've since upped the quality.

I write papers using LaTeX via [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/ "A Mac TeX editor."), with the [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/ "A TeX Live distribution for Mac.") distribution. Like most other people, I used to write papers and other documents using MS Word, but during graduate school I became so fed up with its quirks and irritating behaviors that I vowed to avoid it when possible[^3]. LaTeX is free, source files are viewable and editable plaintext documents, and it generally produces beautiful documents. For collaborative writing, I either use [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com?r=55aaf0b7&rm=d&rs=b "An collaborative LaTeX editor.") or a paper [GitHub](https://github.com "A web-based Git repository hosting service.") repo.

[^3]: Specifically, I was trying to write a conference paper that had strict two-column formatting guidelines. Word refused to keep figures in the locations I placed them.

I use a number of other web apps with my research group and collaborators. [Slack](https://slack.com/ "A team messaging app.") has replaced email as my primary communication medium with my students, and it's great for sharing files, images, and code snippets. I've also been using [Trello](https://trello.com/kyleniemeyer/recommend "A visual team project management system.") to keep track of tasks and deadlines.

I rely on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/idjCJUz "A cloud file backup service.") to both continuously back up my important files in the cloud and sync between my two computers. Dropbox is one of those services that basically just works; I used to rely on all sorts of free space, but have since shelled out for a Pro account (and the 1 TB of storage that comes with it).

[Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01ojqc "An online backup service.") backs up my entire MacBook Pro, invisibly in the background.

For my code development work, I write in [TextMate](https://macromates.com "A powerful Mac text editor.")---and increasingly [Atom](https://atom.io "A cross-platform open-source customizable text editor.")---and use the default Terminal app with ZSH via [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh "A ZSH configuration management framework"). [Homebrew](http://brew.sh "A Mac software package manager") does an excellent job maintaining all of my software packages, and [git](https://git-scm.com "A distributed version control system.") handles all my version control needs.

## What would be your dream setup?

I think I'm approaching my ideal setup, especially in terms of my office vs. home/traveling computer split.

That said, in my office I find that I'm constantly running out of space on my desk. It would be nice to have a bit more room to spread out, perhaps with another table next to my desk to form an L.

For a while now, I've had my eye on the [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/ "A recommended ergonomic keyboard."), but for some reason haven't pulled the trigger on getting it.

If I'm really dreaming, then I'd have a private, GPU-based high-performance computing cluster for all my research computing needs. For now, I'll have to make do with computing resources on campus, and requesting computing time from federally funded supercomputers such as those in NSF's [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org "Federally funded supercomputing resources.").
