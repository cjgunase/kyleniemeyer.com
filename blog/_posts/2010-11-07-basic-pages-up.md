title: Basic pages up...
---

Well, after a little work I’ve got some pages up, including a list of publications (pretty short right now...) and my CV (is that a good way to post it?).

I still want to put up a list of links to other people’s sites that I’ve found helpful, among other things, but that’s it for now.  I’ve been waiting for my advisor to get back to me about the revisions of a paper, but now that’s submitted, so it’s back to research...
