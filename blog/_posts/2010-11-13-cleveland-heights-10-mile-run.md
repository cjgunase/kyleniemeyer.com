title: Cleveland Heights 10 mile run
---

Bria and I are training for a half marathon (about 13 miles), and we are going to try a 10 mile run today! We did an 8 mile run in Pittsburgh on Monday that was pretty tough (basically the longest run either of us have done), so we’ll see how this one goes (but I feel good).

Here’s the route Bria mapped out around Cleveland Heights---it goes around Shaker Lake and Horseshoe Lake, so it should be pretty.
