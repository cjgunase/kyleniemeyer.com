title: My girlfriend is an award-winning cookie baker!
---

My girlfriend, Bryony DuPont (PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon) just won a holiday cookie recipe contest! Michael Ruhlman is a fairly well-known cooking author (he’s from Cleveland!), and he held the contest through [his website](http://ruhlman.com/2010/12/holiday-cookie-challenge-results.html).

I love these cookies: super spicy ginger molasses.  They’re great for the holidays, but also pretty much any other time.
