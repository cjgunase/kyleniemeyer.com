Origin
------

I switched to this site design after a couple years of using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), which was easy but not very powerful or clean looking. I could never find a theme that fit what I had in mind for the site, plus it was hacked at least once (although that may have been due at the server-level, WordPress certainly has vulnerabilities).

So, after seeing a bit about [Jekyll][] and realizing the benefits of a static site (speed, and no way to be hacked other than through the server), I decided to switch. Looking through the [list of sites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites) using Jekyll, I saw [Mark Reid's site](http://mark.reid.name/) and fell in love (with the site design).

Like many other Jekyll users, he hosts his site's source code on [GitHub][] and generously allows people to "borrow" the design---so I did. And promptly customized it for my own purposes, although the style still very much matches his.
